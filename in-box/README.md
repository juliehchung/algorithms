# In Box

What's in the box!? Let's check first if there is actually something IN the box before we figure out WHAT it is...

Check if the asterisk is inside of the box. The function you write must return true only if the asterisk is INSIDE - not if it is anywhere else on or outside of the box.

### Example:
```shell
inBox([
  "####",
  "#* #",
  "#  #",
  "####"
]) ➞ true

inBox([
  "*####",
  "# #",
  "#  #*",
  "####"
]) ➞ false
```
