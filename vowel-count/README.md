# Vowel Count

`Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious` - now you can say it backwards which is `Dociousaliexpisticfragicalirupus`!

But that's going a bit too far, don't you think? This is not a string reversal challenge - did you think it was?

Instead, can you write a function that returns the number of vowels in a string?

In particular, the team at Robin REALLY wants to know how many vowels are in `"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"`!
