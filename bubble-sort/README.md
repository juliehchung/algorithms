# Bubble Sort

Have you heard about bubble sort? Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.

This sorting algorithm is comparison-based. Each pair of adjacent elements are compared and are swapped if they are not in order.

This is a frequently asked level 1 question asked by FAANG. Before you get a call from one of them, why not practice it today?

Please implement bubble sort and explain when this algorithm is least suitable and why.
