# Initial Sort

You are a co-founder to a new, unnamed startup. After bickering for hours over what the venture's name should be, the founding team makes a compromise. They will take the first letter of each of their names, capitalized, and sorted in alphabetical order - this will be the name of the startup. Because your colleagues have pulled two all-nighters in a row, you decide to take one for the team and write a function that will return this new name.

### Example 1
```shell
Input: initials = 'IBHSDJ'
Output: 'BDHIJS'
```

### Example 2
```shell
Input: initials = 'POSH'
Output: 'HOPS'
```
