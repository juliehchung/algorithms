# Date Calculator

How many mores days are left until you think the COVID-19 pandemic will end? Why not write a function to tell you so you don't have to calculate it yourself!

Your function should be structured like below - it should take two dates and return the number of days between the two:

```
function daysToFreedom(date1, date2){}
```
