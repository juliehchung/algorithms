# n-th Factorial

Do you know what a factorial of a number is? You can get the factorial of a number by multiplying all the numbers less than or equal to that number. As an example, `5!` (5 factorial), is equal to `5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 120`. Would you please write a solution for Robin that returns the factorial of that number?

### Example 1:
```shell
Input: factorial = 5
Output: 120
```

### Example 2:
```shell
Input: factorial = 8
Output: 40320
```
