# Calculate Taxes in Cents

Hip hip hooray! It’s tax season! Your CPA has requested that you provide your tax amounts in cents this year. Rather than using pen and paper, wouldn’t it be faster for you to write a function that accepts a dollar amount and a tax percentage and returns the taxed amount in cents?

### Example 1:
```shell
Input: dollars = 900.50, percent = 20
Output: 18010
```

### Example 2:
```shell
Input: dollars = 720.46, percent = 15
Output: 10807
```
