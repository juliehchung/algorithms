# Anagrams

Anagrams are words that contain the exact same letters in the same quantity. Robin challenges you to write a function that accepts two words and returns true if they are anagrams.

**BONUS:** write the function so that it can receive any number of words and returns true if all of them are anagrams of each other.

### Example 1:
```shell
Input: word1 = "silent", word2 = "listen"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```shell
Input: word1 = "yes", word2 = "no"
Output: false
```
